Tutorial 2
==========
This tutorial will be based of the `previous tutorial <tutorial1.html>`_. Please complete it first.

In the last tutorial we leanred how to create a route and how to link it with our templates. In this tutorial we will
learn how to use the database in mercury.

To create a model in Mercury, we can use the CLI once again to create a model:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	python3 -m libmercury create model user

When we run this, mercury automatically creates a model called user. We can see what the CLI created by viewing
src/cargo/user.py:

.. code-block:: python3

	from libmercury.db import Column, Integer, Base

	class user(Base):
	    __tablename__ = "user"
	    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

If you recognise this syntax, it's because Mercury uses SQLAlchemy internally. With this, we can add some simple
columns to our table like username, password, etc.

.. code-block:: python3

	from libmercury.db import Column, Integer, String, Base

	class user(Base):
	    __tablename__ = "user"
	    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	    username = Column(String(20))
	    password = Column(String(50))

Once we created the model, we can't use it yet. This is because our database schema is not synced with the state
of our current models. To sync our models with the database, we can use the CLI to create a migration:

.. code-block:: bash

	python3 -m libmercury create migration first_migration

When we run this, it will output some information about the state of the migration:

.. code-block:: bash

	[Migrator] Starting Migrator
	[Migrator] Loading ORM models
	[Migrator] Loading database schema
	[Migrator] Finding discrepancies...
	[Migrator] Loading discrepancies
	[Migrator] Table 'user' is missing in the database.
	[Migrator] Generated file: src/cargo/migrations/1.py

As we can see, the migration generator figured out that the "user" table is not in the database but is in the ORM. So
to fix this it created a file for us in src/cargo/migrations/1.py. Opening this file shows us as follows:

.. code-block:: python3

	from libmercury.db import MigrationWrapper 

	_version = '1'
	_prev_version = None
	
	def upgrade(url):
	    wrapper = MigrationWrapper(url)
	
	def downgrade(url):
	    wrapper = MigrationWrapper(url)

Using this templated code, in the upgrade function we can use the wrapper variable to perform any necessary
database operations. The same goes for the downgrade funciton, it just reverses the operations in the upgrade
function. The wrapper variable has many functions, but in this case we want to use the wrapper.create_table() function
to create our table. We can do that using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python3

	from libmercury.db import MigrationWrapper, Column, Integer, String 

	_version = '1'
	_prev_version = None
	
	def upgrade(url):
	    wrapper = MigrationWrapper(url)
	    wrapper.create_table("user", [
	        Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True),
	        Column("username", String(20)),
	        Column("password", String(50))
	    ])
	
	def downgrade(url):
	    wrapper = MigrationWrapper(url)
	    wrapper.delete_table("user")

Now that we have created this migration, we can run it using the CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

	python3 -m libmercury migrate

If you did everything correctly, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

	[Migrator] Running migration src/cargo/migrations/1.py
	[Migrator] Table 'user' created successfully.
	[Migrator] 'src/cargo/migrations/1.py' passed with no errors
